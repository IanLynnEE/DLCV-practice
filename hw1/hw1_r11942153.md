#### 2. Accuaracy

The Accuracy of the model A is 0.38.

The Accuracy of the model B is ==TODO==.


#### 3. Implementation details of model A

Trying to implement a LeNet for 3 channels inputs, the number of channels of the first convolution layer is increased to 18, following by a 1x1 convolution layer to reduce the number of channels to 6 again. Even though the results are not ideal, this is the highest for different permutations of layers.

A SGD optimizer was used for this task, with 0.01 learnging rate. As the task is an classification problem, the loss function was set to be Cross Entropy Loss.


#### 4. Implementation details of model B

The model B adopted ResNet50 with pretrained weights provided by torchvision. The main diffenrt is that ResNet50 is a much deeper network, and using residual blocks to avoid gradient vanishing/exploring. More features and high-level features can be extracted from the images, which boost up the accuracy.

To avoid overfitting, `RandomHorizontalFlip` and `RandomResizedCrop` are used in model B.

#### 5. PCA of the second last layer of model A

As the model A performs badly, it's hard to interpret the PCA plot. Moreover, with over 50 classes, saying that some of the classes were seperated better along the training, such as the dots in Cyan, is a bit unrealistic.

#### 6. tSNE of the second last layer of model A

<div style="text-align:center">

    <p><font size=1>tSNE at the start.</font></p>
    <img src='figures/tsne5.png' height=200 />
    <p><font size=1>tSNE after 6 epochs.</font></p>
    <img src='figures/tsne27.png' height=200 />
    <p><font size=1>tSNE after 27 epochs.</font></p>
</div>
Similar to the PCA plot, one might be able to say that speration was getting better, such as the orange dots and Brown dots were getting more pronouncing though out the training, but it's clearly not easily seperable.

#### 2. VGG16-FCN8s

![](figures/VGG16_FCN8s.png)

Noticing that the label 2 (Rangeland) performed tragically in the model A, I took a look at the masks. I believed that identifying Rangeland requires details of the images, so I decided to try FCN8s, as this model used the information from layers with higher resolution.

The implementation is different from those on the internet, as we have 512x512 as input, and I didn't do the cross-channels transforms before upsampling.

The model B was still struggling to identify Rangeland. I didn't use (7x7 conv) in first layer of  the classifier part of VGG16, worrying about lossing resolution. It might be the reason for poor performance.


#### 3. mIoUs of models

The mIoU of the model A is 0.687858

The mIoU of the model B is 0.699997
